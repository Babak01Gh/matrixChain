# matrixChain multiplication
this algorithm gets some matrices with their dimentions
and gives the order that gives minimum multiplication number

## more information about
[matrixChain wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_chain_multiplication)

## give an example of input&output

**example input dimentions**
```
chainOfMatrices = [
    (3,3),
    (3,5),
    (5,2),
    (2,6),
    (6,3)
]
